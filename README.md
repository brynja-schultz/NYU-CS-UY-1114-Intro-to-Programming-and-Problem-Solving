# Intro to Programming and Problem Solving (Python)

*New York University – Tandon School of Engineering*

## Course Context

This repository contains my programming assignments from **Intro to Programming and Problem Solving** at NYU, **Fall 2021 semester**.
The course introduced foundational computer science concepts through Python, focusing on algorithmic thinking, data manipulation, and structured problem-solving.
Assignments progressed from basic syntax to object-oriented programming, with an emphasis on clarity, efficiency, and readability.

**Tech Stack:** Python · Standard Libraries
