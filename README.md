# NYU CS-UY 1114 — Intro to Programming and Problem Solving

This repository contains coursework from **NYU's CS-UY 1114 Intro to Programming and Problem Solving** course.
The assignments focus on learning fundamental programming concepts, computational thinking, and problem decomposition using **Python**.

**Tech Stack:** Python (with standard libraries)

## Course Context

This course is the introductory programming class for computer science majors at NYU.
It provided a foundation in problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and core programming principles, which I later built upon in more advanced courses in algorithms, data structures, computer graphics, and artificial intelligence.
It was also my first formal exposure to programming in Python, which helped me quickly adapt to other languages such as Java, C++, and JavaScript in subsequent coursework and projects.

## Project Highlights

* **Assignment 1** — Introduction to Python, control flow, and basic data handling.
* **Assignment 2** — Lists, loops, and conditional problem-solving.
* **Assignment 3** — Modular programming with functions and iteration.
* **Assignment 4** — File handling and structured program design.
* **Assignment 5** — Working with dictionaries, sets, and data relationships.
* **Assignment 6** — Object-oriented programming and class design basics.

## Skills Developed

* Writing, testing, and debugging Python programs
* Applying control flow constructs (conditionals, loops) to solve problems
* Structuring programs with functions for modularity and reuse
* Reading from and writing to files in Python
* Using core data structures like lists, sets, tuples, and dictionaries
* Implementing basic object-oriented programming with classes and methods
* Designing solutions through problem decomposition and logical structuring

## How to Run

These projects can be run in any Python 3 environment. Example:

```bash
python assignment1/main.py
```

## What to Look For

* Clean, readable, and well-documented Python code
* Logical problem-solving approaches
* Progressive development from basic scripts to object-oriented design
